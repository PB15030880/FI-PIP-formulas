# FI-PIP-formulas
permutational invariant polynomial(PIP) fundamental invariant(FI) formulas.
This is a repository for permutational invariant polynomial(PIP) fundamental invariant(FI) formulas.
Those kind of polynomial are widely adopted in potential energy surface(PES) construction for mulecular dynamics simulation.

There is a .txt file including all the PIP below degree D, and a a .txt file including all selected generators set(FI) below degree D.
Bond length sequence: for atom $i$ and atom $j$ of a system of $N$ atoms, the corresponding bondlength label is $(N-1)i + j-1 -\frac{(i+1)i}{2}$.
Note that $i$, $j$ varies in $0,1,2,3,\cdots, N-1$ and the bondlength label varies from $0$ to $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}-1$.
