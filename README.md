# FI-PIP-formulas
permutational invariant polynomial(PIP) fundamental invariant(FI) formulas.
This is a repository for permutational invariant polynomial(PIP) fundamental invariant(FI) formulas.
Those kind of polynomial are widely adopted in potential energy surface(PES) construction for mulecular dynamics simulation.

There is a .txt file including all the PIP below degree D, and a a .txt file including all selected generators set(FI) below degree D.
